1. To run the code, you just need to run ensemble.py. It will show all hight level info. Please be patient enough, because it may take while(less than 5 mininutes).

2. The project is developed using Python 3.6.3 in Anaconda. To run ensemble.py, you just need one command:

python ensemble.py

3. All code and generated csv files or images file are in ~/code/ directory, all original data is in ~/data/ directory.

4. Since we are required not to deposite the dataset in repository, we delete all .csv files. And the link for original data is:
https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/
 

5. Code runs very well in my computer. If you can't run my code, feel free to contact me. Thanks!
